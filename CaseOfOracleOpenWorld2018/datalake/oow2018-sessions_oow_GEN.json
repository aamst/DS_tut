In this role, reporting to owner and CEO Joe Lacob and owner Peter Guber, Welts oversees all business-related operations for the Warriors, including the development of the Chase Center, a privately financed sports and entertainment center in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood that broke ground in January 2017. He owns the rare distinction of being part of championship teams in the NBA (4), WNBA (2), and NBA G League (1). \nUnder Welts’ direction, the organization has established several franchise benchmarks from a business standpoint in recent years, as the Warriors brand continues to grow in stature following four consecutive NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships in 2015, 2017, and 2018. The organization has won numerous awards across all facets of the business in recent years, including the Warriors being named “Sports Team of the Year” across all sports in both 2014 and 2016 by the Sports Business Journal\/Daily. The Warriors are the first professional team to win this coveted award twice. \nWelts’ impressive résumé includes myriad different capacities spanning virtually every level of an NBA operation. Prior to joining the Warriors in October 2011, he spent nine years as president of the Phoenix Suns. Welts’ responsibilities in Phoenix included the supervision of all business operations for the Suns, while also overseeing the team’s interest in the management of the US Airways Center and the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury. \nAfter leaving the SuperSonics, the University of Washington graduate spent the following three years (1980–1982) at Bob Walsh & Associates, a sports marketing firm in the Seattle area. His non-NBA résumé also includes serving as president of Fox Sports Enterprises (1999–2000). \nIn May of 2011, in a front-page story in the New York Times, Welts became the highest-ranking executive in men’s professional team sports to publicly acknowledge that he is gay. He was presented with a United States Tennis Association 2011 ICON Award at the US Open in New York City, an award that recognizes and celebrates those who have had a positive impact on diversity and inclusion in the sports industry and society. Also in 2011, he was honored with GLSEN’s (Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network) Respect Award, which honors those who have made a difference in the areas of diversity and inclusion. In September 2014, he was honored by GLAAD, the nation’s LGBT media advocacy organization, with the Davidson\/Valentini Award, which is presented to an LGBT media professional who has made a significant difference in promoting equality for the LGBT community. He also served as the celebrity Grand Marshall of San Francisco’s Pride Parade in 2015. In 2016 he was honored by the Anti-Defamation League with its “Torch of Liberty Award.” A member of Delta Chi fraternity while attending the University of Washington, in 2015 he was named “Delta Chi of the Year” by the national organization. \nWelts currently serves as a board member of the Bay Area Council and the Warriors Community Foundation.
