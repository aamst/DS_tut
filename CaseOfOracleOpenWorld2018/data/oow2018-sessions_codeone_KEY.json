New hardware, new software, and new ideas are powering Java toward uses far removed \nfrom that envisioned at its inception. Whether driven by AI or quantum computers, the problems of tomorrow demand new approaches and new thinking. Hear IBM’s evolving vision for the future of Java, and see how IBM and the Java community continue to rise to the challenge of keeping Java vital, healthy, and moving forward. Let’s celebrate the Java community in all its forms and how it continues to give Java the wings to soar.<br>\n<br>\nSuperheroes protect the peace, save lives, and fight evildoers with their superhuman powers; however, they are not the only ones who have these abilities. Each day developers build highly advanced algorithms, design and code solutions to better humanity, deploy to thousands of servers in seconds, and come up with groundbreaking innovations. In this session join community leaders, unconference disorganizers, open-source standards gurus, and technology visionaries to hear an action-packed keynote to celebrate the developer community and you, a groundbreaker.","1":"Making Cloud Native Computing Universal and Sustainable: Harness the Power of Open Source.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Oracle Code One Fireside Chat<\/b><br>\nJoin us as some of today's top developers meet up for a fireside chat.<br><br>\n<b>Building Next-Gen Cloud Native Apps with Embedded Intelligence, Chatbots, and Containers<\/b><br>The cloud is fundamentally changing how enterprise applications are being built today. Developers are leveraging new services and capabilities up and down the stack to more quickly deliver innovation and provide greater ease of use, management, and integration, while also providing deeper intelligence through these applications. In this session see how data science, embedded intelligence, digital assistants, and easy-to-build\/easy-to-manage cloud infrastructure are enabling these next generations of cloud native apps to be built on Oracle Cloud Platform.","2":"GitHub, Java, and the OpenJDK Collaboration at Scale with the Java Community.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs one of the most pervasive technologies of our lifetime, Java continues to innovate the application world around us. Through continued modernization Java offers developers a contemporary language and platform to create the next generation of rich, scalable, and secure enterprise applications. And as the technology landscape changes around us, often at an ever-increasing pace, Java is primed to offer developers continued uniqueness to address new opportunities. In this keynote hear from recognized members of the Oracle Java Team and industry luminaries about how Oracle is continuing to steward ongoing Java technology enhancements. Learn what’s new in Java, see recent additions to the language and platform, and get a look ahead at enhancements that are in development that will continue to improve developer productivity."},"allowDoubleBooking":{"0":"1","1":"1","2":"1"},"attributevalues":{"0":[{"value":"Show Schedule
