Get your voice and opinions heard!","12":"Containers provide much better elasticity and density than VMs, but JVM-based applications are not fully container-ready. The first issue is that HotSpot JVM doesn’t release unused committed heap memory automatically. Second, it is not possible to increase the size of the JVM heap at runtime. To solve these two major issues and make JVM more container-friendly, a new patch is implemented for the Garbage-First collector in OpenJDK 9. This session shares details of what is done and how the added improvements enhance resource consumption efficiency.","13":"Vaadin has announced its next major framework: Vaadin Flow. The biggest change in this version is a focus on PWA and the usage of Web Components instead of GWT for the UI elements, and here come a few questions:<br>\n&bull; Why Web Components?<br>\n&bull; How is this different for existing Vaadin Framework developers?<br>\n&bull; What advantages does it give to web apps developers?<br><br>\nThis session discusses these issues, shows what the code looks like, and presents a demo of how to run the application on Oracle Cloud.","14":"You just got a part-time gig teaching Java at a local school or college. You have a good sense of what you plan to teach, but which IDE should you use? Should you even use an IDE? The answer is quite simple: use Apache NetBeans. As an IDE, NetBeans requires a user to know only a handful of commands. As the student’s skills increase, more features of NetBeans can be revealed. Using the other IDEs out there requires a significant learning curve and makes you spend too much time doing technical support for the IDE. This session explains why you should be teaching with NetBeans and, by extension, why you should be using it in the workplace.","15":"Do you wish you could change things in the software tools you use to make them work better? Inspired by the move of NetBeans to the Apache Foundation, one of this session’s speakers set out to improve the local history function in NetBeans to make it work as desired. This presentation takes you on that journey, from figuring out how to download the code from GitHub, through hacking the code, right through to ending up with a customized history function. Along the way, you will find out how Apache works, how to download the source code and hack it, and how to return the code back as a submission. There are highs, lows, tears, and lots to learn along the way. At the end, you will hopefully be inspired to go out and fix your own tools.","16":"Have you ever wanted to simulate hall acoustics? This session covers how to simulate a hall acousitc and how to implement it on GPU or even on FPGA with Java.","17":"LesFurets.com’s dOOv framework is trying to solve a common problem with software: performance versus readability versus type safety. Since Java 8, lambdas offer the ability to compose functions at runtime with high performance. LesFurets.com built a fluent API, using lambdas to write validation and mapping logic with a DSL. By visiting the DSL abstract syntax tree at runtime, it enables the written application rules to be introspected and profiled. In this BOF, the speakers discuss how the framework was designed, failure cause analysis, AST rewriting, and the issues they encountered in generating the natural language output.","18":"On microservices, manual troubleshooting may be difficult, so automating log analysis and anomaly detection become important. How about the next step ? On traditional systems, engineers have identified the causes of problems, but how about on microservices? Machine learning comes to mind, but most of that needs sufficient trouble cases, which may not be available in a limited test period. A Bayesian network may meet our needs, because it can utilize human knowledge. Such networks have been employed in medical diagnosis, for example. This session discusses how to use a Bayesian network for Java troubleshooting manually and aims to show a proof of concept for automating Java troubleshooting. ","19":"The Java User Groups’ Hispanic Community was created to share knowledge about Java and emerging technologies between Spanish-speaking JUGs, and more than 12 JUGs from Spain and Latin America are a part of this global community.

After 12 weeks, the resulting product was launched into production and paid for itself after one week of use. Now the project has scaled into an initiative called Kessel Run, spanning a dozen projects and employing a lab full of air force personnel in downtown Boston. Join this panel of developers, designers, and product managers for a discussion of how to overcome the challenges of scaling an Agile practice in a large organization: convincing risk-averse leadership, slicing through red tape, and getting buy-in from engineers with legacy mindsets.","24":"The migration from monolith to microservices has empowered engineering teams to develop modular code quickly and efficiently. Although it offers many benefits, this movement has also introduced challenges—namely how to enable fast, secure communication across microservices. One solution to container networking for polyglot microservices is the sidecar model, in which a separate process that manages all network traffic is deployed alongside your microservice. This session explores the benefits of sidecars and shows how they are implemented through two open source projects: Envoy and Istio. By examining how these technologies could be used in both Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, users will be introduced to the true potential of sidecars.","25":"The world of mobility is moving faster than we can imagine. Millennials today don’t talk; they chat. They don’t have addresses; they have locations. They don’t have email; they message. It’s a new world out there, and enterprises either keep innovating or meet their fate alongside Blockbuster, Borders, and Sports Authority. In this session, you will hear about the newest kid on the block, the Intelligent Bot feature of Oracle Mobile Cloud, and how it can help transform your app from another icon cluttering your phone to a transformative part of your business.
