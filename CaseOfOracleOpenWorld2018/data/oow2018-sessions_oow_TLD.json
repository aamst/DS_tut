{"abbreviation":{"0":"TLD6969","1":"TLD6805","2":"TLD6806","3":"TLD6808","4":"TLD6807"},"abstract":{"0":"Technology has enabled us to achieve great things. But it’s also leaving millions of people without access to economic opportunity. Automated solutions are requiring entire populations to reskill. Students entering the workforce today aren’t prepared for the jobs that will be. As tomorrow’s leaders, the future of our teams and our companies is in our hands—and what better ones to shape the future.\n\nJoin Emily Poague, VP Marketing for LinkedIn Learning, to hear how today’s leading minds are empowering people to learn, companies to grow, and economies to rise. You’ll also learn how critical managers are to workplace learning, and how individuals are taking control of their careers to chart new paths into the future of work.\n\nSpeaker: \nEmily Poague\nVP Marketing, LinkedIn Learning\n","1":"In this session learn how new synthetic intelligences will help us make sense of the data explosion, moving AI from just observing the world to making decisions for us and about us. Our deepening relationship with machines will change how we transact, communicate, work, live, love, and even achieve (digital) immortality. If AI is automating human intelligence, virtual technologies are automating human experience. Hear how the concept of content will radically shift as we no longer share just video and images, but 3D objects or even people. Blending real and virtual worlds will take us from fake news to fake worlds. Novel use cases for virtual objects and virtual experiences are blended with the fascinating psychological impacts of life as an avatar.","2":"Some of the most influential breakthroughs of our age, from unraveling the realm of quantum particles to peering into deep realms of space and time, have required talents amassed through large international teams of researchers.  We are in the era of big science. Not only have these pursuits profoundly advanced understanding, they provide powerful case studies for grasping the future of discovery: large, multinational collaborations tackling challenges with strong intellectual ties to fundamental questions. In this session discover some of the hallmark qualities that will define those who lead: Dreaming big, leveraging diverse capacities, investing in basic foundational research, and eschewing quick returns in favor of long-term discovery.","3":"The capabilities of Artificial Intelligence grew exponentially over the last few years, to a point where people now question what the role of humans will be in the future. In this talk, we will explore how AI is entering every aspect of our daily lives, and how it will transform companies, products and the workplace.\n","4":"At a moment when the entire world is reckoning with the impact of technology on our lives, from manipulation of social networks to the misuse of private data to disruption of entire lines of work, those of us who create tech can take a moment for self-reflection about the impact of our work. In this session join a conversation that looks at some key principles about technology that might help us arrive at a new perspective on what our work means in the world. The session also considers what more humane and ethical technology might look like."},"allowDoubleBooking":{"0":"1","1":"1","2":"1","3":"1","4":"1"},"attributevalues":{"0":[{"value":"The Changing
