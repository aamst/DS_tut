With the right tools and libraries, geospatial data can be handled just like any other data in your web app. This presentation gives you an idea and practical examples of how modern open source Java libraries—at the persistency (Hibernate 5), business logic (JTS Topology suite and GeoTools), and UI (v-leaflet, a LeafletJS-based, Vaadin add-on) layers—can help make separate expensive general-purpose GIS systems obsolete, even in web applications.","5":"We often think of old applications as just that, old . . . but what if you could combine both the old established applications and newer emerging technologies such as IoT and chatbots to provide new value to your customers? Come to this session to learn how Oracle Cloud can accelerate the integration of technologies such as IoT and chatbots into your older legacy applications, enabling easier self-service for users and improving the accuracy  of your supply chain.","6":"Adding tests to legacy code is hard, if not sometimes impossible. The code is often difficult to understand and usually written without testing in mind. Changing such code is a fearful task! With Approval Tests, adding tests to untestable and unintelligible code is not only possible but even simple and (believe it or not) fun. Imagine being able to confidently refactor code you don’t understand. That is the power of Approval Tests. Even more, BDD and TDD are also easier with Approval Tests. Come to this session to learn a new way to add tests to old code.","7":"In today's world, more and more people are creating software that is expected to run at large scale. Large scale and cost-effectiveness often lead programmers to asynchronous programming models for handling vertical scalability concerns. Creating an asynchronous application on the JVM is nontrivial and often leads to disparate abstractions. Reactive Streams is one such abstraction that is widely accepted on the JVM today. This presentation is a deep dive into what it takes to implement the Reactive Streams specifications. It delves into various trade-offs that library developers have to consider while implementing Reactive Streams and which aspects of practical applications make such trade-offs easier.","8":"This session presents a guide for enterprises looking to move to production with Kubernetes.
